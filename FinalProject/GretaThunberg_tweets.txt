Our train from Basel was taken out of traffic. So we sat on the floor on 2 different trains. After G√∂ttingen I got a seat.This is no problem of course and I never said it was. Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!

If anyone thinks that what I and the science are saying is advocating for a political view - then that says more about that person than about me.
That being said - some are certainly failing more than others.
I'm sometimes called ‚Äùpolitical". But I've never supported any political party, politician or ideology. I communicate the science and the risks of failing to act on it.
And the fact that the politics needed don't exist today, neither to the right, left nor center. -&gt;

Setting emission cut targets for future dates or becoming ‚Äúclimate neutral‚Äù is much easier if you exclude aviation, shipping, consumption, imports, exports and ‚Äúoffset‚Äù your emissions elsewhere... What we need is real, drastic emission cuts at the source.
https://t.co/mQN8sg5ieb
[I]n the 1990s, it was plausible to imagine that [the 2¬∞C limit] might be met by emissions cuts alone.

The fact that it can still be talked about today is almost entirely thanks to how the models ... have been revised to add ... negative emissions.

https://t.co/xAQqrTN1tO https://t.co/G7jtt7eVWV
1. Listening to #BBCInsideScience with @AdamRutherford my colleague @clequere noted the UK had cut its CO2 by over 40% since 1990. However, include CO2 from aviation &amp; shipping, along with our imports &amp; exports &amp; the UK's  cut in its total carbon emissions is much nearer 10%.

I honestly don‚Äôt understand why adults would choose to spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children for promoting science, when they could do something good instead. I guess they must simply feel so threatened by us. -&gt;
It seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus, since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis.
Being different is not an illness and the current, best available science is not opinions - it‚Äôs facts. -&gt;

Dear media, I see you are writing about the international climate crisis lawsuit @GretaThunberg and I launched today with 15 other child plaintiffs. The other plaintiffs have names, experiences and stories.

These 5 nations are the largest emitters that have ratified the convention.

Our first estimates suggest that over 40,000 people in the whole of Scotland went on strike for the #GlobalClimateStrike. Which means that approximately, 1 in every 125 Scots striked on Friday. Now, that's pretty cool! @GretaThunberg @Fridays4future https://t.co/KPmJRPmvMZ
‚ÄúSo we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed.

To do your best is no longer good enough. We must all do the seemingly impossible.

Obviously Florida has always had hurricanes. But #Dorian rides very hot water, on seas that are higher than they used to be, on a planet where hurricanes now crawl across land more slowly than before.
https://t.co/eWcSItCv4T
Breaking: Hurricane #Dorian has made landfall in the Bahamas at Category 5 strength.

This is the 19th Cat 5 landfall in the Atlantic basin since 1851, the 4th ever to hit the Bahamas, and the 4th in the past three years across the Atlantic.

Before I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didn‚Äôt speak to anyone. I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder.
All of that is gone now, since I have found a meaning, in a world that sometimes seems shallow and meaningless to so many people.
I'm not public about my diagnosis to "hide" behind it, but because I know many ignorant people still see it as an "illness", or something negative. And believe me, my diagnosis has limited me before. &gt;
When haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go. And then you know you‚Äôre winning!
I have Aspergers and that means I‚Äôm sometimes a bit different from the norm. And - given the right circumstances- being different is a superpower.

Keeping temperature below 1.5¬∞C requires radical short-term reductions of fossil CO‚ÇÇ emissions (brown), even with large-scale CO‚ÇÇ removal (negative emissions, green).

Mitigation rates are only slightly lower as the scale of  CO‚ÇÇ removal increases.

Dear Media,

We are in a climate emergency. Stop the jolly heatwave stories and the footage of kids in fountains. 

This is a red alert. 

Treat it like any other disaster. Talk about droughts and species extinction and the culpability of energy companies. 

Yours,

Life on Earth

‚ÄùWhat I would like to ask all of those who question our so called ‚Äòopinions‚Äô, or think that we are extreme, is:

Only 18% of the world's population has ever taken a flight.

In 2017, only 3% of the world's population took a flight. 

People who fly are the anomaly. People who *binge fly* are the extreme anomaly.

Tree planting is fine but look at the numbers. Once all these trillion trees are planted, they take up 200 Gt of carbon in 50-100 years, on average 2-4 Gt/yr. We currently emit 11 Gt/yr and rising. It helps, but at best a fraction - and little at first. https://t.co/YzOG1kfphr

Leadership is difficult.
Leadership is a responsibility. Leadership is about doing things before anybody else does them.
Leadership is about taking risks.
Leadership is about taking decisions when you don‚Äôt know 100% what the outcome is going to be.

Apparently a speakers agency says that you can ‚Äúbook speeches‚Äù from me through them, and that I charge money for my speeches.

This is of course not true, I don‚Äôt belong to any agency and I don‚Äôt charge a cent for my speeches.

On June 21st, @EmmanuelMacron demanded we make his "life impossible", referring to meeting the demands of environmental activists. We took it literally by occupying the Pont de Sully on June 28th, and in return suffered a violent repression.

Cumulative global CO‚ÇÇ emissions since 1751
For each year, a single pixel represents 1 million tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ. 
For perspective: 
1751 = 9 million tonnes (9 pixels)
2018 = 37,100 million tonnes

See massive acceleration at the end.

*Global* CO‚ÇÇ emissions need to go down faster than they went up historically reaching zero by ~2050 &amp; large-scale CO‚ÇÇ  removal is required in all scenarios (either afforestation or by engineered sinks). https://t.co/OMaQu9n0EC

In Sweden, only one newspaper has this on it‚Äôs front page, a tiny piece at the bottom. Not to mention that 415 ppm CO2 was recorded at Mauna Loa a few days ago. The highest concentration for at least 3mn years. This gets no mention in Sweden.
A new UN report concludes that 1mn spices risk extinction because of human activity. And that the destruction of nature threatens humanity.
And yet, this is not top news. As long as it continues like this, as long as the media fails to take responsibility, we stand no chance.

Hi @GretaThunberg 
This one is for you. https://t.co/nNHetTCqHV
World must reach zero fossil-fuel emissions by 2050 to have a chance for 1.5 C. IEA scenarios do not align. With 50 organisations we today sign a letter to the @IEA asking that World Energy Outlook #WEO2019 to reach #ParisAgreement as its central scenario https://t.co/hzuhLvkrWg

Proud to be part of this great call. When we think about a #GreenNewDeal we tend to focus on the built environment - but healing and restoring the natural world is key to carbon drawdown, plus it makes life fuller and richer and can create millions of jobs. https://t.co/532LtBTWQ6

After talking to so many of our leaders I have now realised that they have the climate crisis under control, they understand the emergency and are ready to act.
So I‚Äôve now decided to stop striking and go back to school for good. I will no longer school strike on Fridays.

Perhaps the most dangerous misconception about the climate crisis is that we have to ‚Äúlower‚Äù our emissions. Because that is far from enough. Our emissions have to stop if we are to stay below 1,5/2¬∞C warming.
That rules out most of today‚Äôs politics. Including airport expansions..
Current #Arctic sea ice extent (orange) is not anywhere close to average...

Compared to previous decades:
‚Ä¢ about 700,000 km¬≤ less the 2000s mean

11 days since Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique ‚Äî now one of the worst humanitarian emergencies in the world.

- Hundreds are dead
- 128,000 are living in temporary camps
- UNICEF: ~1,000,000 children are affected
- UN at its highest response level ‚Äî equal to Syria &amp; Yemen https://t.co/dl45L3CcF6
And then we need to get the emissions to minus by inventing new technologies, if we are to stay below 1,5 or 2¬∞C of warming. Which we must...
The fact that we are speaking of ‚Äúlowering‚Äù instead of stopping emissions is perhaps the greatest force behind business as usual.
The ‚Äúlowering of emissions‚Äù is of course necessary but it is only the beginning of a fast process that must lead to a stop within a couple of decades. (Note that rich countries need to get down to zero emissions sooner than that according to the Paris Agreement.)‚Äî&gt;
Perhaps the most dangerous misconception about the climate crisis is that we have to ‚Äúlower‚Äù our emissions. Because that is far from enough. Our emissions have to stop if we are to stay below 1,5/2¬∞C warming.
That rules out most of today‚Äôs politics. Including airport expansions..
We need to teach young people all over the world about climate change and the disasters that are possible because of it, so they can prepare.
For some it is already too late.

Holy shit. In his review of the Stern review, Nordhaus actually imagines that future people might ‚Äúcome to love the altered landscape of the warmer world.‚Äù 

No, really, he does that.
