I started yoga this week and my first class, after giving myself some belly complaints, the instructor said "well didn't you just have a baby!?" and I said "no, like 18 months ago" and she said "that's JUST" and let me tell you, true or not I could have cried.

luna hates them. in New York they don't really hide and they apologize when she freaks and stop photographing. here in LA, they've learned to hide more and you don't know you're being photographed. I'd rather know. https://t.co/i9aIKx7kdS
BUT one time, a guy in nyc shot directly into a dressing room I was changing in. I memorized his face and still hate him.
if you're nice to them, they're good to you. one time I dodged one for miles and hid in an alley. he found me. I lept from my car, shaking and crying that he had a gps on my car. he was so kind and I ended up feeling terrible. it's a job. https://t.co/or9Vr96il8

Yes but also I know that a lot of ours comes from being so open. So you just let security know you‚Äôre okay with hugs and conversation. But my house is a fortress https://t.co/dgqmwlw7JH
you do it all for the odds. 100 no's will get you one yes. and they already know what they want before you get there. you don't wanna be a part of something they don't want anyhow. https://t.co/526qltz8N5

I‚Äôd normally want some kind of potato or rice goodness under this but the Brussels sprouts were awesome and still stopped up all the sauce perfectly. ‚ù§Ô∏è
The Brussels sprouts are crazy easy. 1 pound shredded, tossed with olive oil and 4 cloves minced garlic, salt and pepper. Roast on 400 for 10 mins, toss, cook until brown (about 5 more mins) can also add lemon juice and Parmesan but I kept simple because of the peach bbq sauce

@bigdck420 Do you have kids?
I just tried to have a talk with Luna and said ‚Äúhey. I just want you to know that you‚Äôre a really awesome daughter. I‚Äôm so lucky‚Äù and she said ‚Äúwhat if my name was poo poo pee pee‚Äù
The other day I made chicken Alfredo and she wanted red sauce. So I mixed it with red sauce. Now she only wants pasta with red and white sauce
My point is, kids are literally batshit
Yesterday she screamed for me to pull over. I did, and she goes ‚Äúsmell my feet‚Äù
Luna only wants apple juice served to her with a spoon which I thought was insane until I realized all my liquids were consumed through putting my finger over the top of the straw and adding drips to my mouth
hi @chrissyteigen me again, I took the leftover stew from your short ribs, pur√©ed it, added garlic and cream, shredded the meat, and added pappardelle and just had to tell u it‚Äôs the best dish I‚Äôve ever made or eaten https://t.co/jb873U0DHE

@JamilahLemieux lmao is this edited with clips from the entire show or was it really this long
@cloudy_yah @hilaryagro Completely understand and I don‚Äôt ever forget people are struggling. All I can do is tangible things to help make a difference outside the twitter world. It definitely showed that I‚Äôm a bit removed and I will do better as best I can.
@hilaryagro You keep saying this as if my husband and I don‚Äôt do anything for society and it‚Äôs really disheartening. It was a comment, a joke, a dumb one at that, that I‚Äôm sorry for. I hope we have done and continue to do things that contribute more than a dumb tweet. Again, I apologize.
The typo is destroying me
@FlipDatShhh I hate that I made you feel that way and I apologize!
I promise I will not always say the right thing in the right way but I also promise I hate disappointing or pissing you guys off. I‚Äôm sorry and I will do better to not be such an asshole.
Oh man I haven‚Äôt checked my mentions for a bit and I didn‚Äôt realize how many people were super pissed off about this. It was meant as a joke (and exaggeration) about how my mom doesn‚Äôt realize air pods are with a cord are headphones but it came across as super tone deaf and icky.
@AliciaSilv @gardein @Crossroads I am!! I find it intriguing after discovering my love for @ImpossibleFoods. Anyone who can get me to open my mind up a little is a winner to me!
@newneeno @FilipinoFreak my fault for not explaining well! to be honest, I don't slow cook much and didn't know about the dairy thing either until a couple years ago lol

@Chef_Fletch @Jenn_Harris_ I didn‚Äôt say it was. I literally said it is where we eat.
Anyhoo I‚Äôm not a food critic. I love food. I love to cook it. I don‚Äôt go out much. I love home. The list is an honest list places that we love when I DO get dressed, and doesn‚Äôt mean more!
@Jenn_Harris_ Damn I just finished this and it‚Äôs actually super mean. Cool!

@GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer Oh so I‚Äôm also a pedo for hating the president and calling him a pussy ass bitch. that‚Äôs what it really comes down to. you wouldn‚Äôt give two fucks about any of this if I supported trump. it‚Äôs so fucking beyond odd, your delusions.
@GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer Ok. Expose it already and enough with the fucking ‚ÄúSOON‚Äù shit so you can leave me and my family the fuck alone
@GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer Now you get to talk about how crazy I am. Because you finally cracked me. Congrats.
@GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer If I say so? There is really no helping you people. I‚Äôve really tried with you. Just go now. I hope through this you‚Äôve at least seen you‚Äôre talking to a real life breathing human being that has to read, from you and your people, that I molest fucking kids all day.
@GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer I can‚Äôt fucking win. And I don‚Äôt want to anymore. Can you imagine being in my shoes for a minute? I have a life and a family. What you do to me is sick but I‚Äôm still aware enough to know it‚Äôs not as horrible as what you think is really happening. And what IS happening.
@GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e @entylawyer I don‚Äôt understand the ‚ÄúHollywood is a driving force in the market‚Äù part. I want to say that isn‚Äôt true but the truth is, no one KNOWS if it‚Äôs true. So I won‚Äôt. My old tweets are just that and they were always in reference to something else you guys want to take out of context
@seankent @AnanyaShree9 @MollyJongFast Yeah. We fucking aren‚Äôt. But when you tweet it with conviction, I guess we are.
@GPontificus @AnanyaShree9 @direct7_e A cop out to acknowledge it happens everywhere? What can I do to satisfy you? It seems like nothing and you know it. And what do you mean ‚Äúif‚Äù? Human trafficking IS happening all around us. And the right people fucking care.

@CigarDaisy311 @seankent @AnanyaShree9 @MollyJongFast All good. I know. I‚Äôm just so fucking tired of this shit. Not defending yourself doesn‚Äôt work. Defending yourself doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôd rather get to talk.
@seankent @AnanyaShree9 @MollyJongFast If I go out, I take 10-20 pics with random people a day/night. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck they‚Äôre up to. I think I saw Harvey 3 times in 14 years, out and in public only. But they use this, over and over and over.
@seankent @AnanyaShree9 @MollyJongFast ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. We didn‚Äôt know. We wish we could take it back with what we know now‚Äù does not work for these people. this wasn‚Äôt done in secrecy. What do you want from us. It‚Äôs a photo. A 1 second in time party pic they use over and over and over to accuse us of molesting children.
@alliehagan Lol yes! I love sport
@LisaMariePosso whaaaat
@alexisssotelo üòÇ
it makes me so happy to know people really thought I saw Lebron James at an embroidery shop in downtown LA with a blank jersey
@juristired I feel like maybe it was a livestream or something. But it‚Äôs gone!! my kids will never believe me

Man. My postmate went all the way into the grove to get me a wetzel‚Äôs pretzel. 1000 stars, didn‚Äôt think that would get accepted. Like asking for a dole whip from Disneyland
@laconicways https://t.co/KwLenAFHnI
@laconicways Why back down now? You‚Äôve been mentioning me with her all day. I‚Äôm not blind. I see your tweets. You believe this too. Don‚Äôt bitch out now.
@laconicways Sorry you think you‚Äôve been able to hide behind a tiger woods avi all this time. this accountability thing goes both ways. by all means, say more.
@laconicways I think you‚Äôre the one backing off a bit now, no? I do love that you just do not know when to stop. Oh, it‚Äôs grand.
@laconicways Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna happen now, because I know your type so well. You‚Äôll screen grab this and whine to crokin, and she will post it on her deranged Instagram. Your beliefs about me will heighten and the cycle continues. Do it. Fuck you. Fuck all the way off.
@laconicways @CruzanChoklate so you‚Äôre calling me a pig now and not a pedophile? Just confirming. Pig is fine.
@laconicways @CruzanChoklate Yeah now a photo of her is hanging in my garage because she is deranged and dangerous. Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm saving everything including this.
@CruzanChoklate @AdoreUSAalways sorry you‚Äôre tagged in all this lol. I‚Äôm fucking over it today
@AdoreUSAalways @CruzanChoklate he‚Äôs not gonna fuck you, sweetie
@laconicways @CruzanChoklate Oh wowee zowie a burn and a half
@CruzanChoklate Oh no, I mean me personally. I would take them off and spoon my poop like an animal
@canehdian6acon I agree. This is thicker and curlier, I dunno why they say angel hair!

I know this sounds crazy, but this is actually the most rational response I've gotten from a Q person. I'm not upset by it. if you believe all this, this is a legitimate question/statement.
Hi. I do not know how to tell you that I do not know the answer to this. I sit on my couch, I take care of my kids, work and I cook food. not everyone in Hollywood is some demonic warlord and not everyone has an elaborate agenda. https://t.co/K4H3gsSlS1
@JemmaThinks @JackPosobiec that is quite literally all you say. all day. I see it. all day.

I really love you guys. I am okay I swear!! There is so much good here, in you, and it is why I stay!! You are quite literally my world. Your friend Chrissy has just HAD IT UP TO HEREEEEEE today
@Dawstin1 @sgarber15 Every. Day. And when i do inevitably die, they‚Äôll believe they got me.
@VictoriaDahl er wanting* lksglksdjglsd
@VictoriaDahl like the past 6 months or so I've been feeling so buttoned up, not wanted to talk about anything because it just makes it worse. I feel like myself again!
@VictoriaDahl nah it's ok please don't be - I think I'm just venting and bringing it to light. like life is good but this is really bad, you know? I'm happy and lucky in literally every other way
I can tell when people know I'm losing my mind on twitter and they casually text me funny or nice things without addressing that I'm going absolutely apeshit. I see u and I love u
twitter has honestly done an awesome job with filtering and blocking or if necessary, suspending accounts. instagram is not so good. but I'm not really content anymore with just...not seeing it. I wanna see it and I want to fight this shit.
imagine this, all day every day, on every platform. defending yourself, and that defense just meaning you're getting worried. this is the exact type of person I am flooded with all day, every. fucking. day. https://t.co/oJBNMZGuPS
honestly you guys are so normal and rational that I know it's hard to really understand it. it's easy to say "just block and report" - I literally have to have pics of some of these people in my garage because they live nearby
I saw all this KNOWING they will never be like "oh man, that Chrissy, she's a little too defensive. maybe she ISN'T a pedophile" - I know it'll get worse. I don't care anymore. I'm not tiptoeing around your delusions anymore.
@fordey70 @AlexandraErin I‚Äôm honestly not positive if Q Is my boss or i am Q or they are Q

@nottayIor Maybe since I‚Äôm using them with really rich and heavier things (stews, ramens) I don‚Äôt notice it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever toss them with cheese and lemon or something. But now I wanna try....
I think they have fettuccini, spaghetti, a...rice shaped one. Anyhow I get them online or at Whole Foods and they may or may not change your life.
I use this angel hair one under curries and in porky ramen broths. I truly love the chewy texture of it (I know that isn‚Äôt normally a compliment) - the only weird part is rinsing them before using! But they‚Äôre ready to heat and go after
ok time to tell you about another current obsession I am NOT getting paid for....SHIRATAKE MUSHROOM NOODLES. let me be clear there is no 100% perfect carby noodle replacement (and there shouldn‚Äôt be!!) but THESE ARE GREAT AND DELICIOUS IN THEIR OWN WAY https://t.co/Die4iGJb04

someone do a movie about these accounts. I need to see these people.
cannot imagine sitting on the computer, jerking it to maga models, just waiting for someone, anyone to say anything, anything u can shit on. "oh shit she tweeted about tea HOW DO I MAKE THIS ABOUT TRUMP and what a fucking absolute tool I am" https://t.co/OEj7dvCF3J
@diesel_fish Get help, pigshit.
Anyhoo again, this is not an ad. I just can‚Äôt shut up about it. If you come to my house, you are hearing about this tea. There are so many flavors and it‚Äôs gotten me to drink less horrible shit!
Last night I had the strawberry shortcake tea and aaaaah, so maach like. And there‚Äôs a thai iced tea sprinkle tea thing by the same brand. And and and the lemon ginger. Already sweet and ready to go
I can‚Äôt stop telling everyone i interact with about this tea. I think maybe my mind is blown because I‚Äôve always been staunchly against tea most my life. I have no stake in this and do not know the people behind it but DAMN, I love it https://t.co/PZJlECHPwC
I've spent over 13 years of my life trying to bread fried chicken in varying proportions of parmesan and pork rinds, herbs and spices. when I get it to stick, this will be my legacy

what really gets me is how blown away you guys are by beats being beats and always being able to go over other beats. "it fits perfect!" like...that is a beat. it fits. it isn't magic. but you love it. so it's adorable
I can't tell what song is really in the "joker" steps scene and what you've manipulated. I can't decide if I care
anyhow when I am sad or bored I like to log onto instagram live so the alert freaks out my publicist so I'm just gonna do that all day. miley got them all on edge
anyhow that is my morning rant. fuck you, fucking miserable Q shitfucks, you absolute fucking losers
I have a love justice yes
I have a love justice. when people do wrong, I need them to know they're wrong. this isn't a good or bad thing, but it's me/. the fact I have to learn to let people get away with shit like this is insane to me. it makes me ill inside. yep, they're just crazy! don't worry bout em!
it's not just weirdos in random towns. these people are all over. I hate what some people have become and what social has done for this kind of reach. it sucks. and now they'll post this too, and it'll get even worse. I'm just so fucking tired.
I had a real life before this. I mean...going to the grocery store and shit, parks alone with my kids. now I have a list of people in my area who genuinely believe we are in a pedo ring that is always *ALMOST* about to be exposed
if I take legal action, it gets worse because then, to them, it's true and I'm trying to "silence" them. It's on posts about anything. Random 90 days fan pages, meme accounts, anything. Even if the content is normal, the comments are....this shit.
u know what is not great? I still have to read on social media many times a day that John and I are pedophiles and look at photoshopped/miscaptioned photos of us on "Epstein Island" and I just have to deal with it because "people are crazy these days"
Please keep this setup, im coming over

@AkilahObviously ‚Äúwhat are you‚Äù
@JADubin5 I don‚Äôt think they ever get married, thus no divorce!
Actually you know what? Phyllis and Bob are def still together. Dwight and Angela still together. Michael and Holly definitely together. Mathematically (i got a C+) SOMEONE here has to be divorced. It‚Äôs Jim and Pam.
@Nedsfeed wait what !!!!
They never went to Austin. You know it and I know it. I talk about moving to Austin every other day and here I am. Not in Austin
@oxwof I don‚Äôt think they did I think that was another great idea that never happened!!
Pam is unhappy but content with their income and children so she‚Äôs like whatever and draws things for Etsy like cozy home signs (wait is this me)
I think they‚Äôre together but Philly Jim likes a taste of the high life and bottle service with athletes and Pam still can‚Äôt figure out her phone so he never has to answer FaceTimes and he never gets caught
guys I‚Äôm loving your endless love optimism here but I didn‚Äôt ask what you HOPE for, I asked what you actually think!!
It has been 10 years since Jim and Pam got married. Do you think they are still together, separated, divorced or open marriage

I know they're all on Hulu! That's how I'm watching it. But I'm still insanely confused when and how these air. they need to put in the order you watch every *different* 90 days show since there are like 6 seasons of each show and some have same couples, some different.
@yashar thank u!!! I'm all over the place over here
in what order did TLC air all these different 90 days? I'm really having difficulty navigating people's relationships. The before, the happily ever after, the regular one. do they air these in the same season? the back and forth killing me. and some just...end. sad!!

my friends said they have never seen this kind passion from me about anything. I don't know what came over me. I think I saw one picture of an apple treat and lost my mind. People were worried. it was manic-like behavior
Saturday, I was obsessively talking about apple picking. I wouldn't shutup about it - brought it up in random conversations with friends that had nothing to do with apples. I was insane. Googling farms, sending links to people. begging, begging anyone to listen to me about apples

Imagine eating 30 Oreos, slowly swishing them around your mouth. Reading a ‚Äúfound‚Äù grocery list. Calling mystery phone numbers. Reading a map. For hours. Then u read the Chris Saunt business card
ate an entire box of Oreos (for research) because they sent this giant escape room-like mystery package for their mystery flavor. Little clues all over. crying that the baker left his card in the box. Chris Saunt. this is my kind of humor. Haven‚Äôt laughed that hard in a long time

.@chrissyteigen's new show #BringTheFunny premieres tonight! When we sat down with the social media superstar, she shared what it was like working with co-judges Jeff Foxworthy and Kenan Thompson.

Full interview: https://t.co/UFEXF3654x https://t.co/6MUT7PActH
yes I corrected a tweet OMGAHHHHH U SAW IT wowowowowowowow cool
I'm still blocked by trump. is he gonna honor this ruling? what if, of the 1000 despicable things, not unblocking people gets him impeached. for the record I am blocking him immediately after being unblocked
ok not on my face
@Bensvoice god I need this
has anyone ever put salonpas on their face? I don't want you to google it and tell me if it's safe, I want to know if you personally have done it and it worked or did not work HURRY I'M ABOUT TO
I need a new reality show. is it time for 90 day fianc√©? I never got into it, but I'm willing to dedicate myself

Oh dear. They really do hear everything. #waittiltheend https://t.co/TUeKwY59KK
@andrew_g_utes @Jack_Sapper then hoard some sandwich on a plate in front of you. be prepared. u know better! fool me once!
I guess my point is, as precious as they are, please don't waste time being mad about sandwiches
he says in the update it was not a huge subway sub, more of a local place where the sub isn't GARGANTUAN PARTY TIME SUB. I mean I am not disputing that is a LOT of sub but it's not 12 footlong subs. perhaps 6. lol https://t.co/rDAh4rK7Ne
****if I am drunk enough
@andrew_g_utes yeah but if you're still mad about it the next day (after you got to eat snacks and wings and didn't NOT get any food) then that anger prob isn't good for you, my dude
perhaps a good ol "everyone sucks here" but I think the sub eater sucks less than the people who really still care about this sandwich the next day.
everyone is destroying this guy but I can eat 2 footlongs myself. usually a meatball and a cold cut trio. &amp; meatball is kind of heavy enough to be equal to 2 cold cuts like the sandwich portrayed here. I am going against the grain and saying NTA but a simple "anyone want some?" https://t.co/2zDCWKGHUq

@JaeParks_14 @Badger472 @BernieSanders I apologize for being so defensive in regards to his supporters - I understand that many, sanders stands for the more dire, pressing issues for a lot of people and families so of course the discourse will be more heated when criticism of him arises. I really apologize.
Good morning! https://t.co/1uWKUMtfVo
@Badger472 @BernieSanders I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that and I can‚Äôt imagine. Free healthcare for all I absolutely agree with. There are parts of him I love just like with any other candidate. I would happily vote for him if nominated. I worry he is very ‚Äúpizza Fridays‚Äù - says all the right things.

@Navy_Chick_ @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders I‚Äôm listening and every time you tweet I like him less and less, because I can‚Äôt imagine being lumped into such an aggressively angry sub group that is incapable of questioning or criticism from your own undecided party members.

@laurynsullins19 I really do.
@CreativeMrPen @jamieeierm @BernieSanders You are doing this so, so wrong. I am not anti-Bernie-being-president. People like you are pushing me there though.
@bex0760 @CreativeMrPen @jamieeierm @BernieSanders They have this magnificent ability to completely turn off undecided voters, like myself and many more. Great job!
@BadBanditt Are you high?
I just watched Booksmart for the second time, to show it to friends. Really one of the best comedies in a long long time!
@CreativeMrPen @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Bernie supporters will be the downfall of Bernie. I don‚Äôt even hate him, but you guys are absolutely insufferable. Do him a favor and stop being so combative against democratic criticism.

@numinosity @eh122_dc @yashar I get it! I do.
@numinosity @eh122_dc @yashar It‚Äôs like...the quickest scroll past ever guys
@eh122_dc @numinosity @yashar It‚Äôs a different time now. Sponsored posts from people in my feed is now an expected, given annoyance. If someone‚Äôs good doesn‚Äôt outweigh the annoying bad, then adios.
@therealJMHL @yashar I say no to Instagram shilling ... a few times a day, every day. It needs to be a small part of a larger campaign to be considered. Then I gotta love it.
@numinosity @yashar But like...celebs do hair care commercials or something on your television, or sell a makeup line, they want you to post about it. Unless you are talking about strictly Instagram stuff like tummy tea and corsets (I don‚Äôt do those)
@sgtwheels @yashar It‚Äôs never just Instagram work. You sign up to endorse a brand and do a commercial for them and part of the deal now is always a few social posts. I do it if I love the company and also, the money?
@yashar Going back and forth on email over a sentence change with a brand strategy team who then has to go back and forth with a giant company like unilever/PG is a lot sometimes. But yeah. Just a lot of cooks in the kitchen, more than people imagine.
@yashar I‚Äôll never get it either. And brands do not like bending on their ‚Äúsuggested copy‚Äù so it‚Äôs just easier to do what they say, even though it could be better 100 percent of the time. This is my life.

So it really hurt that I was chosen for this by this man. He was extremely aggressive and trying to get a rise out of me. I wish you could hear what else he said.
@LeilaniMunter @johnlegend @OP_Society You should have seen the other things he said. He only posted what made him look good. It was one of the most terrible run ins of my life. Now I‚Äôm scared to interact with people. I don‚Äôt want to be scared. I appreciate the apology. Xx
@LeilaniMunter @johnlegend @OP_Society If you just be mad at something, I eat a lot of meat. Go for it.

@stuholden she asked about her this morning and I said she‚Äôs sleeping for a while because she wants to be the best hamster she can be
@NebulaBunny whoa this is like a hamster panic room. very cool
thank u mother for not caring enough to get me into college
thank you guys for all your help and tips, really. if you‚Äôre worried for her, please don‚Äôt be. I have all new stuff coming for her now that you‚Äôve taught me so much. she is very loved, I promise.
@mintchocoliam this was all the stuff I was talked into üò© now I know much more! All new stuff coming.

@PeanutStephens omfg
It‚Äôs not weed, it‚Äôs peanut butter with food sprinkled on it. how dumb do u think I am (don‚Äôt answer that)
@SAMpleme1984 I‚Äôm just building it right now okay
@soIoucity lmao
I also put out nest cams on different peanut butter plates so really hoping this isn‚Äôt the one day my kids do something sketchy in their rooms
thank u for your tips. https://t.co/EqwA5J1bBj
@vulvokov @ThePipsqueakery I think what you do is wonderful! We would never surrender her. she is family now (pending she comes back)
alright u nocturnal Houdini. it‚Äôs nightime. operation peanut butter begins
@yooty I feel like she will notice that difference lol
it's condo is on its way. my mistake was buying a cage dumber than the hamster
honestly I researched hamsters more than I did with babies
"you should have done your research before getting a living, breathing animal" well newsflash I had two whole babies I didn't research either
@Valerie_Turner well I can‚Äôt feed her anything now
pics of what SHE‚Äôs GONE https://t.co/q9ZitnG94C
we are doing your peanut butter on a plate trick to find peanut butter. I swear to god if other critters come out of the woodwork for it, john will vomit and die
Oh my fuckin g the hamster is gone again
I just got this alert from Instagram and I‚Äôm so confused as I didn‚Äôt post anything?? have I been hacked? It‚Äôs just my kids and food https://t.co/umaBaExhu0
@BonerWizard Also Diana. I don‚Äôt have Facebook so I need you to keep me up on them
@BonerWizard hello what‚Äôs going on in the pee drinkers group
I just bought her a two story glass condo with a hammock so please stop yelling at me
found her!!
welp the hamster got out. just what you all told me would happen
@ThatGirlKatlyn Omg
I feel like she doesn‚Äôt know how to drink out of her hamster drink thing. I keep showing her and i am starting to feel dumb
Please don‚Äôt feel bad for her. We got her everything and more and a giant space to roam in. If I had a safe enclosure for a hamster farm, i would have that.
is this normal https://t.co/CkBLm0G39Z
I just went to take a picture of her and I honestly can‚Äôt find her
I said ‚Äúshould I get two so they can have a friend?‚Äù And the lady said no, one will end up with a lot of bully scars. So any hamster tips are welcome
They also said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt really touch her for a week. Then touch her a lot or she‚Äôll bite you‚Äù it‚Äôs very confusing, being a hamster mom
They told us we can feed her anything. My mom said ‚Äúrice?‚Äù And they go ‚Äúno, not rice‚Äù
she won‚Äôt come out from her paper dust crap stuff but she is super cute https://t.co/AZFzgkZvgI
Luna and I bought a hamster today. Her name is peanut butter. John is not thrilled, which makes me love her more.

I remember the days when I was floooooord he could sell his wine at national parks. lol oh man that was nothing
I can picture him losing the next election and being like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt wanna do this anyway!‚Äù like a little fucking baby.
For the record he has done 800,000 things worse than the piss tape that definitely exists.
I‚Äôve said ‚Äúthis is gonna be IT for him!!!‚Äù so many times in trump‚Äôs presidency that I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. even pee tape will be another notch in the hell hole that is his term. let‚Äôs just fucking vote this monster out.

no. he doesn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt care. and he doesn‚Äôt care. end of question.
It happens a lot. ‚Äúdoes she ask you if certain things are okay to say?‚Äù ...it‚Äôs just very weird to me.
I feel like a very common question when interviewing john is basically ‚Äúhow do you deal with your wife‚Äù and ... I don‚Äôt love it.

you guys gotta be crazy for thinking totinos would approve an ad saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want good pizza, I want totinos‚Äù
https://t.co/VYeiQ8ddpj
@DaveBngDave That‚Äôs how hyped I was though. I couldn‚Äôt wait to read the B A G
he is now claiming he truly never know they made pizzas
‚Äúnah babe they should def be on a baking sheet‚Äù oh ya think??? I no know how to cook pizza rolls
anyhow this is an actual fight now
u know when you start a story and you‚Äôre like this is gonna be great. but then it just doesn‚Äôt translate well
I am blown away he indulged this conversation, thinking I was talking about rolls. it‚Äôs like when michael Scott was like wow Oscar thinks so little of me when he accepted his horrid gift
and that I would want tiny slices of fresh tomato on a god damn singular pizza roll
it‚Äôs pizza rolls. he has no idea totino‚Äôs makes pizza. but more importantly he thinks I am so stupid I would think tiny pizza rolls go directly onto the rack
we get the notification. John yells ‚Äúit is herrrrrre!!‚Äù Like Oprah
we talk about my childhood a bit. How this pizza shaped my life no big deal
pizza still 20 minutes out, he goes ‚Äúdo you want the tomato on top of it‚Äù and I was like no idiot under it yes it goes on top
For 30 minutes we have been discussing how to ensure crispness. I say it needs to be on the rack. He says no it has to go on a pan. The pizza is merely en route and I‚Äôm so madly excited about it that we are discussing how to handle its arrival
so we postmate some
He said ‚Äúhow many boxes do you want‚Äù and I said first of all loser it‚Äôs in a bag now
I am having a totino‚Äôs craving. I don‚Äôt want a great pizza. I want a pizza from my childhood, with sliced fresh tomatoes on top
I told john I wouldn‚Äôt tweet this but I lied here goes

I am not trying to be edgy. I am trying to avoid a short burst of joy when I get more joy from the months I get of talking about a shitty movie
